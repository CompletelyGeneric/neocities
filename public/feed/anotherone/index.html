    <p>fuck dude these are so difficult to write. I feel like my emotions used to be a lot easier to discern. things are now permeated and mediated by levels of difficulty. Working on this website has helped some though. I've never rolled a website from scratch before. I've copy and pasted large blocks of CSS before but never like, written every line. Idk these distinctions are not even that important. I think letting go of distinctions like this. It's not that the blending of the two is what is meaningful either, the total anhiliation of the category is.</p>
<p>Update, well its much later now. I'm glad I at least got some work done on the site.</p>
