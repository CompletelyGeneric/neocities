    <p>woof, ok so I have to write something as filler so I might as well describe what I've done so far. I'm making this site using zola, which really does seem like overkill at this point. honestly even using sass feels like overkill, especially when I'm bad at it. You don't want to peep the style-sheets there's some really fucked up nesting happening that I can already see being a probem in the future.</p>
<p>I suppose I should test out paragraphs and like markdown features right. Ok so basically what I want to implement now:</p>
<ol>
<li>a cute lil arrow thing before the blog post title in the feeds section, I have some ideas but design is hard and not my passsion.</li>
<li>taxonomies. this is a big one. maybe even have like, accent stuff that corresponds with the category be generated by Zola. That would be so rad.</li>
<li>theme the individual posts.</li>
<li>I literally only made the header so far lol woozy.</li>
<li>a big word cloud of all the words from my posts that is statically generated no JS</li>
</ol>
