ok yeah so cool. what i really want to do is this: so I want to be able to put like 3 lines behind the heading for a specific taxon. [(like on this page for example)](http://127.0.0.1:1111/tags/site-stuff/). I'm unsure how I'm going to do this. I've tried using linear gradients but that definetely isnt going to work.  
  

UPDATE: 04/29/2023, we're going to go with adding tag-color-specific forward slashes before posts! 

UPDATE: WEW WE DID IT
