fuck dude these are so difficult to write. I feel like my emotions used to be a lot easier to discern. things are now permeated and mediated by levels of difficulty. Working on this website has helped some though. I've never rolled a website from scratch before. I've copy and pasted large blocks of CSS before but never like, written every line. Idk these distinctions are not even that important. I think letting go of distinctions like this. It's not that the blending of the two is what is meaningful either, the total anhiliation of the category is.  
  
  Update, well its much later now. I'm glad I at least got some work done on the site.
