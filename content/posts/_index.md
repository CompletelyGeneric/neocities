[//]: # place posts as individual markdown files in this directory, It is recommended to specify a title (will be rendered)
[//]: # and a description in the zola frontmatter. (between the 3 pluses put title="your title" and description="your description")
[//]: # It is also recommended to specify at least one taxon of the 'tags' category, see zola taxonomy docs on how to specify that for pages. If you do not, a post will not appear in the explore section. Tags are arbitrary, but some tags are privileged and given consistent colors throughout the site. You can specify your own custom privileged tags, in sass/globals.scss, and classes for each tag will be generated in sass/components/tag-display.scss
