I'm Riley! This is my website! I made this site so that I have a place to put things on the internet. I think this place will always be a work in progress, so sorry if stuff doesn't work quite right. I was born in NC, and grew up in Alabama and, after highschool I went to university in new england. I drank a lot for 4-5 years so that didn't work out. I play guitar a whole lot. I like to read. I have a cat named Doobie. Thats all I think.





im trying to learn how to be kinder to myself and those around me
